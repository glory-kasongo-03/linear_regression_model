linear_regression_model

The project is about creating a linear regression model that should predict the output of the function y = 2x + 1 using synthetic data for training.
My approached was to first find out the output of a linear regression model to have an idea in case I have a running project then come up with the code.
Once that was done, I used ChatGPT to assist me in creating the code for a linear regression model which it did.
Unfortunately the code that was provided contained multiple errors of which some I managed to resolve and others I couldn't resolve even after requesting ChatGPT to offer solutions of which it did but still I came up short.
Results were not favorable as the project didn't run and it wasn't possible to evaluate the model.
In the end I realised that although we have AI (ChatGPT) at our disposal, we can't always rely on that because as I have learned on this project, there are problems that AI can't resolve, and we must apply our knowledge.
